# Nordic Android Gradle Plugins

A collection of **Gradle plugins** and a **version catalog** used across all Nordic Semiconductor Android projects.  
This repository provides a unified, maintainable build setup for developing and releasing Nordic Android libraries and applications.

## Overview

The **Nordic Android Gradle Plugins** project consists of two main parts:

### Gradle Plugins
A set of internal plugins that standardize build configurations across Nordic projects.

- Common configuration for libraries and applications
- Integration with **Maven Central**, **Dokka**, and **Android Gradle Plugin**
- Simplified setup for consistent builds across repositories

See [PLUGINS.md](./PLUGINS.md) for details.

### Version Catalog
A shared **Gradle Version Catalog** defining all third-party dependencies and their versions in one central place.  
This ensures consistency and easy dependency upgrades across all Nordic Android projects.

See [VERSION_CATALOG.md](./VERSION_CATALOG.md) for details.
